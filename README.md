# CS-255-System-Analysis-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
      DriverPass was a client who was looking to change the way people prepared and took their driver tests.  They wanted to design a system that would allow them to watch lessons, schedule driving lessoons, and take practice tests. 
      
# What did you do particularly well?
      I think I was able to put the business requirements together quite well.  I was able to handle the interviews and get the custeomr needs to create the needed documents for our design team to put everything together. 
      
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
      While I feel that I got the conept and the diagrams done well, I feel that they can be imporved on, and if I went back and redesigned some of them I would do so.  Make them a little bit easier to follow.  I think a couple of them are not the easiest to follow, even though all the informaiton is there. 
      
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
       I took a look at everyting that the client wanted and then thought about it from auser perspective and then used some of their stories to put the diagrams and the documents together.  It is important to take their needs into the design because the users are going to be the ones using the system.  If it doesn't work the way they want it or need it to, they  will not use it.  
       
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
        I approach deisgn very similar to how this class was laid out.  I like to get the information I need up front from the client, and then I like to put some diagrams together..  Then after I have that I like to break it down into pieces and put everyting to gethter like a puzzle until it is complete and ready for implementation. IN the future I think I will continue to use this strategy because it works very well.
